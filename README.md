# amchartJava-core

This repository contains core functionality of [amchartsJava](https://github.com/ifcunharro/amchartsJava) project.

amchartsJava-core is the unique module of amchartsJava that can be used alone. Use a version adapted of amcharts API, only API JSON, don't use JavaScript API. 

Validate users entries and generate configuration in json format that can be used in method makeChart to generate a chart, also can load other time json generated to java objects. It's recommended load only json generated by app, actually isn't implemented all amcharts API and json must be valid json, amcharts allow invalid json.
